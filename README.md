MunSeeker Greenhouse Mk1 TAC
============================

A greenhouse designed for TAC Life Support (version 0.9 and up), based on the stock Cupola model. Converts Electricity (a lot), Waste, Carbon Dioxide and Waste Water to Food. 

Converts Electricity (a lot), Waste, Carbon Dioxide and Waste Water to Food. 

There is some loss in this process, so the crew will still need to be supplied. One greenhouse will use 100% of the waste products of 3 Kerbals (waste, waste water and carbon dioxide) and supply them with roughly 30% oxygen, 60% water and 70% food of their total needs.

Growing food in a cramped greenhouse in zero G is energy intensive. One greenhouse uses about 1.4 Electrical Units per second, or about 5000 per hour (the RTG produces about 0.75/second, so two RTG could supply one greenhouses).

My goal was to realistically extend the food supply for a crew of kerbonauts without completely removing the need of regular resupply missions. This is a good companion to the TAC Carbon Extractor and Water Purifier. The greenhouse is heavy (6 tons) and needs oodles of energy, so its use needs careful consideration.

The model references the stock cupola with a new texture, the configuration is based on the TAC recyclers with some ideas from the Simple Greenhouse (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80410-DEV-HALTED-Simple-TAC-LS-Greenhouse-v0-1) by marce.
