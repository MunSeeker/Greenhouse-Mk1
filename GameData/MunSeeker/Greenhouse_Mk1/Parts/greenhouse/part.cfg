description = A greenhouse designed for TAC life support. Converts Electricity (a lot), Waste, Carbon Dioxide and Waste Water to Food. There is some loss in this process, so the crew will still need to be supplied. One greenhouse will use 100% of the waste products of 3 Kerbals and supply them with 30% Oxygen, 60% Water and 70% Food of their total needs.
